Included for convenience is the original version of AStar 2D.
Support for this version will be dropped in favour of the udpated version.

The original version requires Unity 5.1.0 or newer.
You should not import the legacy version into a project that includes the updated version. Instead you should delete all AStar 2D folders excluding this 'Legacy' folder and then import the package.
